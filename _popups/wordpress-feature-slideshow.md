    - title: "✅ <b>Small but effective</b> : Although the slideshow doesn’t take up much space on the screen, because the rest is shadowed it does a great job drawing the users’ attention.<br>
                ✅ <b>Visual support</b> : With visuals to support the explanation in the copy, WordPress helps users get a good feel of how the feature works. Visualization also keeps users engaged and helps them remember details.<br>
                ✅ <b>Skippable</b> : In case the onboarding element is viewed by a user who is already familiar with the update, or in case there are users who are uninterested, WordPress puts a close button on the slideshow which is always a great practice.<br>"
