title: "EverNote’s signup onboarding keeps it simple and segmented"
description: "Evernote’s signup onboarding is done in a few steps as EverNote asks its users two 3-option questions. The first one is about the use case of the user and the second is for the type of document the user wants to create. The answers to these questions help EverNote segment users and onboard better."

    - title: "✅ <b>Few options</b> : It is common knowledge among UX designers that signup onboarding questions should have as few options as possible to have general fields and less stress for the users. EverNote makes note of that by going with 3 options both times.<br>
                ✅ <b>Progress bar</b> : Even when it is a signup onboarding, a progress bar is a vital point. Since EverNote’s initial onboarding is rather long, the progress bar is a great element to utilize.<br>
                ✅ <b> Great icons and design</b> : As a part of its branding, EverNote uses the color green in every part of its onboarding and tool. The design is completed with tiny icons that improve the UX and make it easier for users to engage with the product.<br>"
