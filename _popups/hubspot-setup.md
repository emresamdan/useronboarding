    - title: "✅ <b>Short and Simple</b> : HubSpot minimizes the setup process to only 3 steps which makes it less time-consuming and simpler for the users.<br>
	          ✅ <b>Clear Communication</b> : Although the setup is done in 3 steps, there are further instructions below to make sure everything goes smoothly for the user. What’s even better is that these instructions are also short and simple.<br>
	          ✅ <b>Skippable</b> :  If your hosting settings are already set or you simply want to skip, HubSpot lets you do so by taking you to your DNS records. This way, you aren’t naively skipping, you become aware of the records before doing so.<br>"
