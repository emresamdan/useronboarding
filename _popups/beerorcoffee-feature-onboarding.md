title: "BeerOrCoffee’s feature onboarding comes with a video"
description: "BeerOrCoffee prefers contextual onboarding for specific features and functions, and they do so by prompting users with a tour modal and tooltips with a progress bar. In this example, they use a tour modal that reads “learn how to reserve a place in 1 minute” and they show it through tooltips when the button is clicked on."

    - title: "✅ <b>Video support</b> : BeerOrCoffee supports both video learners and interactive learners by putting both contents together. The tour modal to the interactive onboarding has a video in it for the ones who prefer videos.<br>
                ✅ <b>Short, highlighted tooltips</b> : Because they use contextual onboarding, BeerOrCoffee has the option to show everything on a given page or section of the tool, all shortly and still explanatory.<br>
                ✅ <b>Interactive</b> : BeerOrCoffee users get to use the buttons and bars on the page as they are being onboarded. Because they get to interact with the tool right of the bat, they learn about it easily.<br>"
