    - title: "✅ <b>Non-aggressive hotspot</b> : SendGrid uses a non-aggressive hotspot to introduce its new feature rather than a big, non-stop pulsing one that will annoy the users.<br>
                ✅ <b>Concise copy</b> : SendGrid keeps it short and simple in the copy of the tooltip. It has a clear call to action and no unnecessary information.<br>
                ✅ <b>No need for close button</b> : Sendgrid’s announcement is pretty short and so is the tooltip. So, there is no reason to pinpoint a tiny close button.<br>"
