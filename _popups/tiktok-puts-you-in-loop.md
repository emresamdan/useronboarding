    - title: "✅ <b>Low-pressure</b> : TikTok doesn’t ask for login info as soon as a user steps into the app. It simply asks them what they like and starts showing them that. The only learning experience is a piece of animation.<br>
                ✅ <b>Visual learning</b> : Since TikTok is all about watching and seeing, the onboarding makes use of visuals rather than words, or uses them supplementarily. <br>
                ✅ <b>Personalization</b> : While TikTok doesn’t concern itself with user login counts, it cares about personalization. So it starts off by asking what the user would like to watch before anything else.<br>"
