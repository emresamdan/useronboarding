    - title: "✅ <b>Short and simple</b> : UserFlow’s survey is already the type that users would want to answer since it will help them choose but it is also made so by keeping it short and the options as few as possible.<br>
                ✅ <b>Skippable</b> : Users can simply skip the survey and pick a plan themselves. IT is a great practice to put the skip option as the first piece of copy on the survey.<br>
                ✅ <b>Help option</b> : UserFlow knows that users might have more questions than the survey can answer so they put a help button down below.<br>"
