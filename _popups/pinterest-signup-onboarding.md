    - title: "✅ <b>Short and simple</b> : Pinterest keeps it short and simple, asking only the necessary questions and giving only enough options. This minimalistic onboarding is appreciated greatly by users since it not only saves time but also doesn’t require great focus.<br>
                ✅ <b>Progress bar</b> : The progress bar as well as a progress marker makes the onboarding more navigable and bearable for users. <br>
                ✅ <b>Laser-focused on personalization</b> : Almost all three steps of the onboarding aims to bring out a personalized experience for the user rather than learning which is a great feature since users might see more benefit in it.<br>"
