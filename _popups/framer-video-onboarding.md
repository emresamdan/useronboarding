    - title: "✅ <b>Great for video learners</b> : Although interactive onboarding is much more preferable today, video content is still a solid learning tool. Moreover, Framer turns the video content into interactive onboarding by putting it on the platform in a pausable manner.<br>
                ✅ <b>Easier navigation between features</b> : Instead of going back and forth tooltips, users can rewind or replay videos for a better understanding of features.<br>
                ✅ <b>Pause and try</b> : Users can easily pause the video which will dismiss the video window altogether for users to use the tool itself. By going for such an onboarding, Framer makes it possible for users to pause and try what they have learned.<br>"
