    - title: "✅ <b>What the user needs</b> : Because the users have no idea the word or sentence is, the users are forced to click on the tooltip. However, it is not actually forced on the user but is a user need at the point.<br>
                ✅ <b>Simple but effective</b> : The copy and the tooltip is quite simple in terms of wording and shape but it is effective in getting the user to interact with it.<br>
                ✅ <b>Great highlighting</b> : Duolingo not only darkens the background but also highlights the word in purple as well. This way, users innately know exactly what to click on.<br>"
