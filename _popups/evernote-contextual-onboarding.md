    - title: "✅ <b>Great copy</b> : The copy within the tooltip is short and to the point but beyond that, what makes Evernote’s copy great is the copy on the buttons that go “show me” and “try it”. By using such wording, Evernote lets the users feel totally in control and not forced into using a new tool.<br>
                ✅ <b>Video content</b> : Because it is a very short video, Evernote can make use of video content to explain its features and arguably even does a better job than other methods of feature explanation.<br>
                ✅ <b>Dismissible</b> : Although the tooltip seemingly has no close button, it is easily dismissible by clicking any other part of the screen. This is often a better option for closing onboarding elements on mobile.<br>"
