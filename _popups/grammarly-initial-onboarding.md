    - title: "✅ <b>Quick and simple</b> : Grammarly’s quick tour really is quick but it succeeds in giving the appropriate amount of initial information. This is done by tooltips that are opened through hotspots, giving the user the lead.<br>
                ✅ <b>Demo environment</b> : In Grammarly’s case, a demo environment comes in really handy. In a user document it may not be possible to showcase all Grammarly features. But thanks to a demo document, users can see a holistic view of Grammarly.<br>
                ✅ <b>Skip the tour</b> : Skipping a tour should always be an option and Grammarly knows that. This is especially important for Grammarly’s case since there may be users already familiar with it.<br>"
