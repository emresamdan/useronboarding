    - title: "✅ <b>Friendly and understanding</b> : One thing that most tools might be missing is some chill. By letting the users take a breath and get comfortable before the tour, Typeform does an exceptional job. <br>
              ✅ <b>Good copy</b> : Typeform doesn’t go with a “start the tour” button. Instead, there is a “show me the highlights” button that basically sends a message to the user saying it won’t take long and they will only see the important bits.<br>
              ✅ <b>Skip button larger than usual</b> : Instead of just going with a “close” button, Typeform makes use of both a “close” button and a “no thanks” button right next to the start button. This way, they make sure the user frustration is minimal by being just a little more understanding. <br>"
