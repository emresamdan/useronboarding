    - title: "✅ <b>Interactive</b> : Since Plandisc’s platform is a rather complicated one for unfamiliar users, it is best to put what’s learned into use right away. Plandisc does exactly that by using an interactive onboarding that requires users to click and write throughout.<br>
                ✅ <b>Good copy</b> : The voice used in the tooltips as well as the emojis show that Plandisc cares about a personal experience for their users, while it also pushes the users to move through the onboarding faster and lose less time.<br>
                ✅ <b>Contextual hotspot</b> : By using a hotspot to offer a guide on a specific feature, Plandisc not only uses onboarding elements in a contextual way but also avoids user frustration since the guide isn’t forced on the users.<br>"
