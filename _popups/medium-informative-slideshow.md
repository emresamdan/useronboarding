    - title: "✅ <b>Subtle but effective</b> : Medium’s educational slideshow that resembles a bigger tooltip doesn’t have any highlighting or background shadowing. It is the same color as the background and overall very subtle if not for its size. Yet it is still effective since users can refer to it at all times without the need to dismiss it.<br>
                ✅ <b>Visual support</b> : Thanks to the visuals included in the slideshow, users can remember the features and shortcuts more easily.<br>
                ✅ <b>To-the-point</b> : Instead of going with tooltips, explaining details back and forth, Medium puts all the info in one place. For example, all the shortcuts being given to the user at one go instead of showing them one by one is a great practice.<br>"
