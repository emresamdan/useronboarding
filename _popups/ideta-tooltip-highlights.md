    - title: "✅ <b>Short and to-the-point</b> : Ideta keeps the tooltips and modals to a total of 6, which is a great practice since more than 7 steps can often be intimidating for users and thus might be skipped.<br>
                ✅ <b>Interactive</b> : Ideta makes sure to not only show the users around the tool but also lets them interact with buttons and other features shown in the tour.<br>
                ✅ <b>Conscious of user needs</b> : One of the coolest things Ideta does is highlighting the help button along with the product tour so that users won’t have to deal with the darkened background and leave the tour to get help.<br>"
