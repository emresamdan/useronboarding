title: "Lemlist’s onboarding makes sure the user is comfortable and well-taught"
description: "Lemlist’s onboarding flow starts with a signup onboarding asking users their proficiency with the tool, then moves on to integrations which is a skippable step. After that, users can create a test campaign and send it to either one of the Lemlist team members. All this process can be tracked through a checklist. "
