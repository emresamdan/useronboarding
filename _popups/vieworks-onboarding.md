    - title: "✅ <b>Several steps, short copy</b> : Although it is not a very common practice, Vieworks’ 14-step product tour works just right thanks to the fact that the copy on the tooltips are quite short and thus the users are given the confidence that the flow won’t take long despite having many steps.<br>
                ✅ <b>Hyper-focused</b> : Throughout Vieworks’ onboarding process, the users are focused on relevant information and fields on the screen using background shadows. This helps users focus on the onboarding easily.<br>
                ✅ <b>Interactive</b> : Almost half of Vieworks’ product tour has a call to action, getting users to click on buttons or fill in areas. This makes the users an active part of the onboarding process which helps them understand and engage better.<br>"
