    - title: "✅ <b>Right onboarding element</b> : Using a pop-up or a modal covering the whole page is often annoying when it comes to promoter surveys. That’s why ClickUp’s survey is better than most.<br>
              ✅ <b>Personalized</b> : Because Click Up generates a different message for every score, it is easier to sympathize with it and therefore, they can receive more feedback.<br>
              ✅ <b>Skippable</b> : Being skippable is a must for any type of survey but it is often overlooked. By letting the users skip the survey, ClickUp create an even better brand image.<br>"
