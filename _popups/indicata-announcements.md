title: "Indicata’s announcements are subtle but effective"
description: "Indicata uses tooltips and announcement modals to let their users know about their newest feature and their newest report. For the prior, they make use of a hotspot that opens a tooltip with a video in it, and for the latter they prompt an announcement modal on the right side of the screen."

    - title: "✅ <b>Good use of hotspot</b> : By opting not to go with an in-your-face approach and placing their announcements in hotspots and on-the-side modals, Indicata puts low pressure on users’<br>
                ✅ <b>Video content done right</b> : Indicata’s in-tooltip video is shorther than a minute and very explanatory. Instead of going for a number of tooltips, Indicata wisely chooses inserting a short video instead.<br>
                ✅ <b>Low-pressure</b> : New feature announcements are often done through announcement modals or in-app messages in SaaS tools. By using a hotspot instead, Indicata goes for subtlety which is almost always well appreciated by users<br>"
