    - title: "✅ <b>Tooltip and hotspot combo</b> : By explaining with a tooltip and directing with a hotspot, UserFlow makes great use of a combo of prominent onboarding UX patterns.<br>
                ✅ <b>Dismissable tooltip</b> : Because the users don’t need the tooltip to go further with the onboarding flow, it is a good practice to have the tooltip be dismissable.<br>
                ✅ <b>No need for shadowing</b> : UserFlow’s onboarding needs no shadowing since they make use of a hotspot that works as a beacon, showing the users where to focus and look at.<br>"
