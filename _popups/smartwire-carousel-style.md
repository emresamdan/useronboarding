    - title: "✅ <b>Everything in one place</b> : Although we are used to seeing onboarding examples scattered around a tool or website, Smartwire says all they have to say in one go and in one place. By doing so, they manage to keep it short and simple and actually show the visitors what’s new before they dismiss the modal.<br>
                ✅ <b>Awesome gifs</b> : Instead of going for a whole onboarding flow or using videos that might not be played, Smartwire uses gifs, which guarantees that visitors/users at least see a glimpse of what’s up.<br>
                ✅ <b>Hotspots</b> : In the last gif in the modal, Smartwire says to check hotspots on the website for more info, which is a genius way of saying just enough at first and directing users to find out for themselves later.<br>"
