    - title: "✅ <b>Low pressure</b> : Since the EverNote onboarding has many tooltips as it is, using empty states for simpler steps in the onboıarding flow creates a low-pressure environment for the user.<br>
                ✅ <b>Interactive</b> : Though there is no tooltip or modal to exact interactivity, the empty state call to action is enough to get a user to interact with the tool.<br>
                ✅ <b>Good copy and formatting</b> : By using short and precise calls to action, Evernote maximizes users’ interaction with the tool, while the formatting of the paragraphs to create a reading hierarchy and the color green being used as a part of the EverNote brand help this goal.<br>"
