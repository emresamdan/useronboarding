    - title: "✅ <b>Placed right</b> : Rather than informing the users with a big pop-up or an announcement modal for something they don’t necessarily want to lose time with, Sendgrid places their announcement by the left-hand side of the screen, which slightly covers an important portion of it and thus makes the users take notice.<br>
                ✅ <b>Long copy made readable</b> : SendGrid has an unusually long copy for their update announcement but it is made readable thanks to properly placed paragraphs and bold words.<br>
                ✅ <b>Good shadowing</b> : Because SendGrid adds a bit of shadowing to highlight the update message, they hint at the users that it is important information. Yet they also use a close button to make sure they don’t annoy the users.<br>"
