title: "Trello’s new feature onboarding actually cares if you want the new features or not"
description: "Trello introduces a new way of using the navigation bar and onboards users to it using modals and tooltips. Trello then asks the users whether they would like to keep using the old version of the navigation bar or switch to the new one."

    - title: "✅ <b>Short, clear tooltips</b> : An important thing about tooltips is to always keep them short and concise, sadly not many abide by this unwritten rule. Trello gets a head start in user engagement by putting this into action.<br>
                ✅ <b>Great progress marker</b> : Just like the tooltip itself, a sequence of tooltips is best when it is short. By keeping it to 4 consecutive tooltips and showcasing it clearly, Trello achieves completion rates easily.<br>
                ✅ <b>Considerate of the users</b> : The very last modal at the end of the new feature tour is probably one of the best practices when introducing something new. Trello recognizes that some users might not want to jump into a new setup right away, and lets them take their time by asking if they want to switch to the new and improved version.<br>"
