    - title: "✅ <b>Subtle and collapsed</b> : Oftentimes, in-app messages and especially the ones about updates and maintenance are boring and annoying for users. To make it less so but still viewable, Notion goes for a subtle message design that is collapsed together when more than one.<br>
                ✅ <b>Personal </b> : The little doodle of David from Notion and the direct voice talking to the user makes this in-app message a personal experience that makes users subconsciously care more.<br>
                ✅ <b>Close button</b> : The close button is always a must, but in this case, it doesn’t appear until you hover over the message itself. This alone makes sure the users somehow view the message when normally most users don’t even take a second look.<br>"
