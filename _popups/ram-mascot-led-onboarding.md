    - title: "✅ <b>Mascot helps focus</b> : Thanks to the presence of Sam throughout the onboarding flow, the users become more likely to engage better with the learning process and remember details since it is almost like it’s coming from a real person.<br>
                ✅ <b>Personal feel</b> : Because Sam refers to each user by their name, the users find it easier to take the onboarding seriously, and generally a more personal feel is created.<br>
                ✅ <b>Short and skippable</b> : While the initial onboarding flow is a mere 5-step one, the next flow is a whopping 18-step one. Yet this is no trouble since all tooltips are skippable. <br>"
