    - title: "✅ <b>Human talk</b> : Pinterest’s permission pop-up’s power comes from its human talk that makes sure to explain instead of state like regular permission pop-ups. By talking directly to the users, it clears up any confusion regarding the permission.<br>
                ✅ <b>Engaging images</b> : The illustrations behind and the emojis within the text make the pop-up a fun one, as well as the icons next to the texts below.<br>
                ✅ <b>Clear CTA button</b> : Even though the copy on the button reads a simple “next”, it pops up because of its color and becomes a clear call to action.<br>"
