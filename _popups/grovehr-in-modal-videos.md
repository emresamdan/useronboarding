    - title: "✅ <b>Attention-grabbing</b> : Grove HR knows that video content is always an attention grabber, and they make good use of it. Especially when the video content is short and fun, they can be more effective than other methods.<br>
                ✅ <b>More accessible</b> : Video teaching is a solid onboarding method, but often overlooked since most customers tend to ignore video content or just not look for it altogether. By putting it in the very first welcome modal, Grove HR makes sure their video content is accessed.<br>
                ✅ <b>Great onboarding shortcut</b> : Video content can be an effective onboarding strategy if the product at hand requires too little or too much learning. For Grove HR, using videos in modals works as a shortcut.<br>"
