title: "CitizenShipper’s onboarding is quick and painless"
description: "CitizenShipper is among the ones that prefer keeping the onboarding flow short. The flow starts with a welcome modal and continues with highlighted tooltips showing users the basics of the platform. They also use a resource center to help users who have skipped the onboarding and are in need of help."

    - title: "✅ <b>Skip button</b> : One of the primary things that make CitizenShipper’s onboarding great is the skip button on the welcome modal. This tool takes the frustration of taking an unnecessary onboarding away and compared to a close button, performs better.<br>
                ✅ <b>Few steps, explanatory copy</b> : CitizenShipper’s onboarding flow consists of only 7 steps which have quite the explanatory pieces f copy instead of short ones. This way, the users have the confidence that the onboarding will take little time and are willing to read the relatively longer copy.<br>
                ✅ <b>Help always available</b> : Because there is a big skip button for the onboarding, it is only natural that there will be extra skippers who actually need to learn the product. Thanks to the resource center, these users can find out how to use the tool and much more by themselves.<br>"
