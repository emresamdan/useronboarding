    - title: "✅ <b>Made easy to read</b> : Though the copy on the tooltip is fairly long for an onboarding tooltip, it is made easier to read using text formatting and emojis.<br>
                ✅ <b>Personal feel</b> : Because it reads “David from Notion” at the top of the tooltip, the users get the feeling that they are being personally reached out to.<br>
                ✅ <b>Background shadow</b> : Since the new feature takes up a very small portion of the screen, it is a must that Notion with its black and white color palette uses good shadowing when prompting tooltips.<br>"
