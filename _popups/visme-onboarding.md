    - title: "✅ <b>General options</b> : When such onboarding questions are asked, it is a great practice to keep the number of options as few as possible. By only giving four general options, Visme increases the chances of better user engagement.<br>
                ✅ <b>Colorful and fun</b> : Although it doesn’t seem like an important component of user onboarding, good illustrations and colorful UX elements go a long way. Since Visme is a creativity tool, they don’t disappoint. <br>
                ✅ <b>Good copy</b> : By explaining each option in a simple short piece of copy and also stating the reason for such a question, Visme increases user trust and interaction.<br>"
