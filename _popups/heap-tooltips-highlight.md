    - title: "✅ <b>Low-pressure announcement</b> : By using a hotspot&tooltip combo instead of an announcement modal, Heap keeps it low-pressure and makes sure to include a close button to let users skip.<br>
                ✅ <b>Contextual</b> :Because Heap uses a hotspot, it takes the user where the new feature is supposed to be. This way, the users can experience the feature in the context of its own.<br>
                ✅ <b>Fun look</b> : Thanks to the vignette shadow, the users aren’t only focusing easily but also get the feeling the light is coming from a flashlight. This way, onboarding is made more fun.<br>"
