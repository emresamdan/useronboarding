    - title: "✅ <b>Eye-catching</b> : The colorful banner Figma uses on the announcement modal helps the announcement become more noticeable and not easily dismissed. Using opposite color schemes helps achieve this psychological trick.<br>
                ✅ <b>Copy done right</b> : Because Figma creates a hierarchy of texts in the modal, it is easier for users to read through it although it seems long at first sight. Bolding the names of the new features also helps make the copy skimmable for users.<br>
                ✅ <b>Explanatory</b> : Thanks to the fact that Figma explains what each feature does in the modal’s copy, the users who don’t have the time to go through a demo also become familiar with them.<br>"
