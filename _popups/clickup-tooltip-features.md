    - title: "✅ <b>Right choice of onboarding element</b> : Rather than using a new feature popup or a promotional modal, it is better to use a tooltip for recommendation purposes. Because it is smaller and often fades into the background, it doesn’t annoy users.<br>
              ✅ <b>Interactive</b> : Because the tooltip is situated right on the feature button itself, the tooltip becomes an interactive solution rather than a static copy.<br>
              ✅ <b>Gifs make it easier</b> : ClickUp uses a gif inside the tooltip which makes it slightly less interactive but less annoying for the users since they won’t have to go through the process themselves.<br>"
