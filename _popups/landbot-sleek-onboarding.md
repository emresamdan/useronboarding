    - title: "✅ <b>A mascot can make a big difference</b> : Landbot’s mascot Landbot creates a relaxed mood for the user, and although the onboarding flow is rather long, because of Landbot’s appearance here and there, it feels shorter and simpler.<br>
                ✅ <b>Eye-candy design</b> : Landbot has a nicely designed onboarding flow with great highlighting and tooltips as well as the “skip tour” button and progress marker above the tooltips. This automatically makes the onboarding flow more bearable and even fun, though it is generally a disliked process.<br>
                ✅ <b>Celebration animation</b> : When a user completes the onboarding flow, Landbot prompts a celebration animation that covers the screen with confetti. Although this is a small addition to the flow, it goes a long way by giving the user an early win.<br>"
