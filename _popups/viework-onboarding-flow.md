    - title: "✅ <b>Interactive</b> : Vieworks’ product tour doesn’t just show you around but gets you to do necessary tasks while you are at it, like entering your company name.<br>
                ✅ <b>Progress bar</b> : Vieworks uses one of the best types of progress bars with not only a progress marker that indicates the nine tooltips to come but also a horizontal progress bar that is subtle and cool.<br>
                ✅ <b>Great highlighting</b> : Vieworks uses just the appropriate amount of highlighting by darkening the background to make users see the relevant parts of the screen.<br>"
