    - title: "✅ <b>Right element used</b> : A promotional modal, basically a pop-up, is the best onboarding element to use when you are trying to convince users to perform a certain action. It is right in the center of the screen so it can be easily seen and since the message is not necessarily annoying, it works.<br>
              ✅ <b>Catches the attention</b> : Because the modal is in the center and because the users see a huge picture of a dollar bill, this onboarding element isn’t one that will be closed as soon as it pops. This is possibly the best performance you can achieve with a pop-up.<br>
              ✅ <b>Copy done right</b> : The picture catches the attention, but it is the way the copy is written that gets the users to interact with the modal. The big “WAIT!” not only prompts you to read more but also creates a fun voice for the brand. The “$1” is also written in money green and makes the users want it more.<br>"
